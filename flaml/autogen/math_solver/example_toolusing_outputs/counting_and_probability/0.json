  "solution": "There are a total of $\\dbinom{20}{2}=190$ ways to choose two distinct vertices.  When the line is drawn connecting these vertices, some will correspond to edges or face diagonals, and the rest will lie inside the dodecahedron. Each of the 12 pentagonal faces has 5 edges.  This makes a total of $5\\cdot12=60$ edges.  This counts each edge twice, once for each adjacent face, so there are only $60/2=30$ edges.  Each of the 12 pentagonal faces also has $5$ face diagonals.  This can be seen by drawing out an example, or remembering that an $n$ sided polygon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ face diagonals.  This is a total of $5\\cdot 12= 60$ face diagonals.\n\nTherefore, of the 190 ways to choose two vertices, $190-30-60=100$ will give lines that lie inside the dodecahedron when connected.  The probability of selecting such a pair is then: $$\\frac{100}{190}=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{19}}$$",

To count the number of distinct pairs, we can use the combination formula:\n\nC(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n\nwhere n is the total number of items and k is the number of items we want to choose from the set. In this case, we want to find the number of 2-element combinations from a set of 20 elements.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of distinct pairs using the combination formula and python:\n\n{ \"tool\" : \"python\", \n  \"query\": \"from math import factorial\\npairs = factorial(20) / (factorial(2) * factorial(20 - 2))\\nprint(pairs)\"\n}"

Thus, the total number of edges = total vertices * 3\n\nHowever, this counts each edge twice since it connects two vertices. To account for this overcounting, we need to divide the result by 2.\n\nNow let's calculate the total number of edges using python:\n\n{ \"tool\" : \"python\", \n  \"query\": \"edges = (20 * 3) / 2\\nprint(edges)\"\n}"
