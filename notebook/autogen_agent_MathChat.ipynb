    "# Using MathChat to solve math problems\n",
    "\n",
    "MathChat is a convesational framework for math problem solving. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use MathChat to solve math problems. MathChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and `MathUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (More details in `autogen_agent_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb`). Essentailly, `MathUserProxyAgent` implements a different auto reply mechanism corresponding to the MathChat prompts. The original implementation and exeperiments of MathChat is in this [branch](https://github.com/kevin666aa/FLAML/tree/gpt_math_solver/flaml/autogen/math), and you can find more details in our paper [An Empirical Study on Challenging Math Problem Solving with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01337).\n",

For there to be exactly one solution for $x$, then the discriminant of the given quadratic must be equal to zero. Thus, $(k+1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = (k+1)^2 - 16 = 0$, so $k+1 = \\pm 4$.
